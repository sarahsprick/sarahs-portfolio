                            As a long-time Spotify Premium subscriber and an avid listener of the "Made For You" playlists (created by Spotify to "help you discover more of what you love"), I have always been curious about the metrics used to determine what I may like. I have also been curious about whether my Spotify Wrapped provided at the end of each year is accurate.
                            <br /><br />
                            When this year's Spotify Wrapped was released, I did a little research on what personal data was available to me from Spotify. Turns out, they give you access to quite a bit. To dig into this idea, I used data both provided by Spotify and downloaded by Spotify’s API about my account to see what songs/artists dominate my streaming history, when I listen the most, whether there are any common audio features, and more!

                            The first section uses my streaming history using my account data found <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The turnaround time for this request took around ~5 days. I received a <strong>.zip</strong> folder with multiple <strong>.json</strong> files about my playlists, search queries, payment, followers/following accounts, stream history, etc. from the last 12 months. For this project, I am going to be focusing on the latter (streaming history).
                            <br /><br />
                            I recieved 3 <strong>.json</strong> files of streaming history because there is a max of 10,000 rows per file. Used a for loop to append each file to one large DataFrame.

                            Converted the <strong>endTime</strong> column to datetime format, then created new columns called <strong>day</strong>, <strong>time</strong>, and <strong>day_week</strong> using this information. Created a new column called <strong>minutes_played</strong> which converts <strong>msPlayed</strong> from milliseconds to minutes. Renamed columns to a more readable format.

                            In the next section, I use data from Spotify's Web API. I created a developer account <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. You do not need a Spotify Premium subscription, but will need a Spotify account to access this tool. The process to retrieve the data is a little complicated. <a href="https://stmorse.github.io/journal/spotify-api.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven Morse's post titled "Exploring the Spotify API in Python"</a> and <a href="https://jman4190.medium.com/build-your-own-spotify-wrapped-with-python-spotify-and-glide-apps-493dc7da20b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Mannelly's blog post titled "How to Build Your Own Spotify Wrapped with Python, Spotipy and Glide Apps"</a> were excellent resources I used to help me get the information needed. 
                            <br /><br />
                            Part of the reason I chose this route was because the streaming data provided by Spotify (used in the section prior to this) only contained simple information like the artist's name, track name, and date. I was interested in getting more detail about the music I listen to.
                            <br /><br />
                            I am not going to include the process of retrieving the data here, check out the articles linked above or the project's Jupyter Notebook for details.

                            <strong>What were my most listened to artists based on the number of minutes listened to?</strong> Dang! Looks like I spent a lot of time listening to Karen and Georgia in their show, My Favorite Murder. Although the sum of minutes listened to greatly exceeded my second most listened to artist, they only accounted for 14.29% of my total minutes listening on the Spotify platform.

                            No, there was no significant correlation between genre 1 and any of the audio features. This was surprising to me. I thought, for example, if the genre was rap, then speechiness would be high. This was not the case, however, the following pairs of values did have the top 3 significant positive correlations.

                            Looking at my Spotify streaming history from the last year, I really liked listening to Mac Miller, Suicideboys, and Pouya for tracks, while My Favorite Murder and Mile Higher were my top podcasts. “Void” and “Materialism as a Means to an End” were my most listened tracks. I was not surprised to see that most of my listening occurred on weekdays.
                            <br /><br />
                            Comparing my analysis to what was provided to me in the Spotify application, their top artists, top songs, etc. all matched mine.
                            <br /><br /> 
                            However, I was surprised to see that rap and dark rap were my most listened-to genres. You may be looking at this analysis and thinking I have a dedicated taste in music. I promise this has not always been the case. It would be interesting to see how 2022 compares to prior years. Maybe this will be my next project. :)

This specific dataset was used in the company’s <a href="https://www.mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-space-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maven Space Challenge</a> (this is basically a challenge where all participants use the same dataset and use their tool of choice to see who can create the best visualization). I found the data too late to actually participate in this challenge, but did utilize their analysis questions and created a visualization as though I was a participant. I thought this dataset looked interesting and wanted to explore it!

                            Below are the questions provided by Maven Analytics for suggested analysis:
                            <br /><br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. How have rocket launches trended across time? Has mission success rate increased?
                            <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Which countries have had the most successful space missions? Has it always been that way?
                            <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Which rocket has been used for the most space missions? Is it still active?
                            <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Are there any patterns you can notice with the launch locations?
                            <br /><br />
                            For the most part, I took these questions into consideration while performing my analysis but definitely did some additional exploring.

                            I would not say I am a huge history buff, but a portion I do enjoy learning about is the Space Race. This dataset displays the competition between the United States and USSR (displayed as Russia) well. We can see that both countries are nearly tied for total space missions approaching 1,500. It was interesting to see the small peak of failed missions toward the beginning (1957) when people first began traveling to space compared to later when successful missions overpower the failed ones.

                            Since being a kid, I have had an interest in storm events. From tornadoes to hurricanes to evensimply rain, I would be watching the Weather Channel waiting for the latest updates. When I discovered that the National Centers for Environmental Information's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) published data on all storm events, I knew I had to take a look. This project is focused on exploratory data analysis and simple visualizations in python.

                            The data published by NOAA is split by year and can be found for download <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. To drill down on my area of analysis, I chose to look at storm events that took place in the year 2021 (I would have preferred the latest data, 2022, but the year is not over and I prioritized completeness rather than timeliness). The dataset consists of 3 <strong>.csv.gz</strong> files (details, fatalities, location) linked by the event ID about storms and other significant weather phenomena:
                            <br /><br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⬥ <strong>Details:</strong> 51 columns and 61,110 rows
                            <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⬥ <strong>Fatalities:</strong> 11 columns and 978 rows
                            <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⬥ <strong>Location:</strong> 21 columns and 58,271 rows

                            At the time of use, all files were last modified 2022-10-18 16:07.

                            The downloaded dataset was provided in <strong>.csv.gz</strong> format. I would say I am pretty comfortable with <strong>.csv</strong> files, however I have never encountered a <strong>.csv.gz</strong> so this required some research on how to handle. I opted to use a Jupyter Notebook for my analysis rather than SQL because I could simply use the <strong>.read_csv</strong> function from pandas rather than having to convert the file types and mess around with any settings to get them inserted into SSMS. 
                            <br /><br />
                            The first thing I do whenever starting with a new dataset is run a <strong>for</strong> loop that converts the column names to lowercase and snake case. This makes it easier for future me to reference the columns. 
                            <br /><br />
                            <img src="images/weather/1.png" alt=""  width="700" />
                            <br /><br />
                            The dates are split up with the year and month in one column and the day in a seperate column (locations does not include the day field). I created a new column that combines these two fields into a complete date.
                            <br /><br />
                            <img src="images/weather/2.png" alt="" width="700" />
                            <br /><br />
                            The <strong>damage_property</strong> and <strong>damage_crops</strong> columns contain information about the monetary damage caused by a storm event. The current formatting (ex. $10.00K to represent 10,000), is not useful for aggregate functions. I converted the columns from an object data type to integer and creating a new column called <strong>damage_total</strong> which is the sum of the two for each row.
                            <br /><br />
                            <img src="images/weather/3.png" alt="" width="700" />
                            <br /><br />
                            In the fatalities dataset, I created bins that categorize the <strong>fatality_age</strong> into the following categories: '0-18', '19-24', '25-34', '35-44', '45-54', '55-64', and '65+'.'
                            <br /><br />

                            <br /><br />
                            There was some additional cleaning performed on the datasets, but the above is just a summary of the most notable.

                            To gain a better understaing of the data and how the tables interact with eachother, I performed some exploratory data analysis. This is simple code to see either summary statistics or to get a better understanding of the data characteristics.

                            Since this dataset includes a variety of different data types (like location coordinates), this allowed me the opportunity to create interesting visualizations using some new-to-me packages in python. Screenshotted below are some of my favorite and, in my opinion, most insightful visualizations I created for this project. Again, please check out the corresponding Jupyter Notebook to see all visuals and interact with them if the package allows.

                            Based on my analysis, hurricanes are the most devastating storm event in terms of both money and lives lost. The highest Enhanced Fujita Scale rating assigned in 2021 was 4 and there were a total of 9 tornadoes that occurred in the year with this rating. Majority of these tornadoes occurred in the same storm event in southwest Kentucky. I was not surprised to see that the top age category for storm event associated fatalities was 65+. However, I was surprised to learn that of this age category, wind accounted for the most deaths. This may be something I research further in the future. My definition of wind may be very different than NOAA’s.
                            <br /><br />
                            Overall, I really enjoyed this project. It allowed me to practice skills learned in my Masters of Science in Data Science coursework while also leading me to discover new packages and ideologies with python.

                            In this project, I explore the UFO Sightings dataset from Maven Analtics’s <a href="https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data playground</a>. Although I may not believe in aliens in the way they are commonly depicted in the media, I still thought this would be an interesting dataset to explore

                            My process from the uncleaned data to an aesthetcally pleasing visual was to load the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook to clean and explore then transform the pandas DataFrame to a csv to be used in a Tableau dashboard.

                            As previously stated, the data for this project was downloaded from Maven Analytic’s <a href="https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data playground</a>. The .csv file includes 11 columns and 80,332 rows of UFO sightings across the world from 1909 to 2014. The columns include field such as city, state, country, lat/long, shape, duration, date/time, and comments. Per Maven Analytic’s site, the dat was added on 9/9/2020 and originally sourced from the National UFO Reporting Center.

                            The first thing I do whenever starting with a new dataset is run a <strong>for</strong> loop that converts the column names to lowercase and snake case. This makes it easier for future me to reference the columns.

                            I am going to focus my analysis on UFO sightings that occurred in the United States. Created a new DataFrame called <strong>ufo_us</strong> which includes all rows where the country is equal to <strong>us</strong>. This narrowed down the number of rows being analyzed from 80,332 to 65,114.
                            <br /><br />

                            The <strong>ufo_us</strong> DataFrame contains rows where the sighting occurred in US territories (ex. Puerto Rico). To narrow down the DataFrame even further, I created a list of the 50 states and am overwiting the ufo_us DataFrame where values in the state column are in the list of states. This narrowed down the number of rows being analyzed from 65,114 to 65,082.

                            The comments column includes HTML character codes rather than the characters themselves. I replaced the code with their respective characters.

                            To gain a better understaing of the data, I performed some exploratory data analysis. This is simple code to see either summary statistics or to get a better understanding of the data characteristics. Below are the questions provided by Maven Analytics for suggested analysis:
                            <br /><br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Figure out which shapes of UFOs tend to be seen most often.
                            <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Take a look at data since the year 2000. How have annual sightings trended?
                            <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Dig into the US data. Which states report the most UFO sightings? What do you think about this?
                            <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Create a histogram to understand the distribution of the duration of UFO sightings (you'll need to do some cleaning first)
                            <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Look at the data in the comments column. What other interesting insights can you pull out of this data?
                            <br /><br />
                            I used these questions as inspiration for my analysis, but did not following them 100%. There were aspects of their questions that I found interested and from there, branched off to my own interests about the data.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>What shapes of UFOs tend to be seen most often?</strong> The 'light' shape was seen most often at 21.2% of total sightings or 13,471 total times. The 'triangle' shape was seen second most at 10.3% or 6,548 times.

                            <strong>Take a look at data since the year 2000. How have annual sightings trended?</strong> Since 2000, the number of sightings by year saw an overall upward trend and peaked in 2012. After the peak, the number of sightings drastically decreased.

                            <strong>Which states report the most UFO sightings? What do you think about this?</strong> 'california' saw the most sightings with a total of 8,912 or 13.7% of total sightings. Two factors I believe may play into this are that it is the most populous state and moving east away from the coast, the desert terrain offers clearer skies for sightings.

                            <strong>What time of day did most sightings occur?</strong> To better visualize this, I created a new column called time_category which bins the datetime column into the following categories: '0:00 - 3:59', '4:00 - 7:59', '8:00 - 11:59', '12:00 - 15:59', '16:00 - 19:59', '20:00 - 23:59'. There were a total of 31,836 sightings or 48.9% of total sightings during the 8:00 PM - 11:59 PM bin. This may be due to the requirement of darkness to better see anomalies in the sky.

                            <strong>What is the typical duration for a UFO sighting?</strong> Created a new column called duration_(minutes) which is simply the duration_(seconds) converted to minutes. Placed these values on a box and whisker plot (excluding outliers). The long upper whisker indicates that there may be a larger variance among the greater values in the fourth quartile. duration_(minutes) is positively skewed. The median duration is around 3 minutes.

                            <strong>Which months have the most sightings?</strong> The most sightings were in 'july.' There were a total of 7,649 sightings or 11.8% of the total.

                            <strong>Which words occurred most in the comments?</strong> Used .split(), .explode(), and to_list() to create a list of all words in the comments column. Then, used .most_common() to better understand which words were used most. Besides the determiners, some of the most frequent words were 'light(s)', 'over', 'object', 'sky', 'moving', etc.

                            I was super excited to visualize this data because of the geospatial columns. Maps are one of my favorite kinds of visuals. After cleaning and doing some exploratory data analysis in Jupyter Notebook, I saved the DataFrame to as <strong>.csv</strong> and loaded it into Tableau. A new technique that I tried was using Canva to create the background image for the dashboard. I did not create anything too complex, but it was fun to incorporate another medium to the visualization process!
