                            Since being a kid, I have had an interest in storm events. From tornadoes to hurricanes to evensimply rain, I would be watching the Weather Channel waiting for the latest updates. When I discovered that the National Centers for Environmental Information's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) published data on all storm events, I knew I had to take a look. This project is focused on exploratory data analysis and simple visualizations in python.

                        <br />
                        <p style="line-height:100%"><span style="font-size: 15px">
                            The data published by NOAA is split by year and can be found for download <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. To drill down on my area of analysis, I chose to look at storm events that took place in the year 2021 (I would have preferred the latest data, 2022, but the year is not over and I prioritized completeness rather than timeliness). The dataset consists of 3 <strong>.csv.gz</strong> files (details, fatalities, location) linked by the event ID about storms and other significant weather phenomena:
                            <br /><br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⬥ <strong>Details:</strong> 51 columns and 61,110 rows
                            <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⬥ <strong>Fatalities:</strong> 11 columns and 978 rows
                            <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⬥ <strong>Location:</strong> 21 columns and 58,271 rows
                            <br /><br />
                            At the time of use, all files were last modified 2022-10-18 16:07. More information about the data can be found on the NOAA <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/faq.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a> page and information regarding the fields/columns can be found <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/Storm-Data-Bulk-csv-Format.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

                        <h5>Import & Cleaning</h5>
                        <br />

                            The downloaded dataset was provided in <strong>.csv.gz</strong> format. I would say I am pretty comfortable with <strong>.csv</strong> files, however I have never encountered a <strong>.csv.gz</strong> so this required some research on how to handle. I opted to use a Jupyter Notebook for my analysis rather than SQL because I could simply use the <strong>.read_csv</strong> function from pandas rather than having to convert the file types and mess around with any settings to get them inserted into SSMS. 
                            <br /><br />
                            The first thing I do whenever starting with a new dataset is run a <strong>for</strong> loop that converts the column names to lowercase and snake case. This makes it easier for future me to reference the columns. 
                            <br /><br />
                            <img src="images/weather/1.png" alt=""  width="700" />
                            <br /><br />
                            The dates are split up with the year and month in one column and the day in a seperate column (locations does not include the day field). I created a new column that combines these two fields into a complete date.
                            <br /><br />
                            <img src="images/weather/2.png" alt="" width="700" />
                            <br /><br />
                            The <strong>damage_property</strong> and <strong>damage_crops</strong> columns contain information about the monetary damage caused by a storm event. The current formatting (ex. $10.00K to represent 10,000), is not useful for aggregate functions. I converted the columns from an object data type to integer and creating a new column called <strong>damage_total</strong> which is the sum of the two for each row.
                            <br /><br />
                            <img src="images/weather/3.png" alt="" width="700" />
                            <br /><br />
                            In the fatalities dataset, I created bins that categorize the <strong>fatality_age</strong> into the following categories: '0-18', '19-24', '25-34', '35-44', '45-54', '55-64', and '65+'.'
                            <br /><br />
                            <img src="images/weather/10.png" alt="" width="700" />
                            <br /><br />
                            There was some additional cleaning performed on the datasets, but the above is just a summary of the most notable.

                            To gain a better understaing of the data and how the tables interact with eachother, I performed some exploratory data analysis. This is simple code to see either summary statistics or to get a better understanding of the data characteristics.

                            Since this dataset includes a variety of different data types (like location coordinates), this allowed me the opportunity to create interesting visualizations using some new-to-me packages in python. Screenshotted below are some of my favorite and, in my opinion, most insightful visualizations I created for this project. Again, please check out the corresponding Jupyter Notebook to see all visuals and interact with them if the package allows.

                            Based on my analysis, hurricanes are the most devastating storm event in terms of both money and lives lost. The highest Enhanced Fujita Scale rating assigned in 2021 was 4 and there were a total of 9 tornadoes that occurred in the year with this rating. Majority of these tornadoes occurred in the same storm event in southwest Kentucky. I was not surprised to see that the top age category for storm event associated fatalities was 65+. However, I was surprised to learn that of this age category, wind accounted for the most deaths. This may be something I research further in the future. My definition of wind may be very different than NOAA’s.
                            <br /><br />
                            Overall, I really enjoyed this project. It allowed me to practice skills learned in my Masters of Science in Data Science coursework while also leading me to discover new packages and ideologies with python.
